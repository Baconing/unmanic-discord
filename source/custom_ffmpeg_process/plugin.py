    UNMANIC PLUGINS OVERVIEW:

        Plugins are stand-alone Python modules that are executed at defined stages during
        the optimisation process.

        The Plugin class is made up of defined "runner" functions. For each of these functions,
        whatever parameters are provided must also be returned in the form of a tuple.

        A Plugin class may contain any number of plugin "runner" functions, however they may
        only have one of each type.

        A Plugin class may be configured by providing a dictionary "Settings" class in it's header.
        This will be accessible to users from within the Unmanic Plugin Manager WebUI.
        Plugin settings will be callable from any of the Plugin class' "runner" functions.

        A Plugin has limited access to the Unmanic process' data. However, there is no limit
        on what a plugin may carryout when it's "runner" processes are called. The only requirement
        is that the data provided to the "runner" function is returned once the execution of that
        function is complete.

        A System class has been provided to feed data to the Plugin class at the discretion of the
        Plugin's developer.
        System information can be obtained using the following syntax:
            ```
            system = System()
            system_info = system.info()
            ```
        In this above example, the system_info variable will be filled with a dictionary of a range
        of system information.

    THIS EXAMPLE:

        > The Worker Process Plugin runner
            :param data     - Dictionary object of data that will configure how the FFMPEG process is executed.

class Settings(PluginSettings):
    """
    An object to hold a dictionary of settings accessible to the Plugin
    class and able to be configured by users from within the Unmanic WebUI.

    This class has a number of methods available to it for accessing these settings:

        > get_setting(<key>)            - Fetch a single setting value. Or set "all" as the key argument and return the
                                        full dictionary
        > set_setting(<key>, <value>)   - Set a singe setting value.
                                        Used by the Unmanic WebUI to save user settings.
                                        Settings are stored on disk in order to be persistent.

        "exec_ffmpeg": True
    }


def on_worker_process(data):
    """
    Runner function - carries out additional processing during the worker stages of a task.

    The 'data' object argument includes:
        exec_ffmpeg             - Boolean, should Unmanic run FFMPEG with the data returned from this plugin.
        file_probe              - A dictionary object containing the current file probe state.
        ffmpeg_args             - A list of Unmanic's default FFMPEG args.
        file_in                 - The source file to be processed by the FFMPEG command.
        file_out                - The destination that the FFMPEG command will output.
