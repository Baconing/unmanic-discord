## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as
possible. Have a look at the [issue template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) for ideas.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing

> issue in the body of your new one.


### Suggesting New Features

You are welcome to submit ideas for new features and enhancements, just include
as many details as possible, including potential implementation options.


### Opening Pull Requests

Code contributions are very welcome. However, please understand that by opening a pull 
requests you hand over copyright ownership of that work to the Unmanic project and the
project owner.
Your contribution becomes licensed under the same license as the project and ownership
is handed over to the project owner. 
This extends upon paragraph 11 of the Terms & Conditions stipulated in the GPL v3.0

All pull requests must be opened to merge into the staging branch. No pull requests 
will be merged into the master branch.


### Quality control

The only plugins that will be allowed in the official Plugin repo are those that are
vetted and pass a quality control screening process.

All plugins must be tested with the latest release of Unmanic for compatibility.
